## How It Works

Merit takes your test results CSV file and transforms it into actionable insights:

1. **Parse** - Reads your test results with inputs, outputs, and error messages
2. **Cluster** - Groups similar errors and generates descriptive patterns
3. **Analyze** - Identifies problematic code and suggests fixes
4. **Report** - Creates an interactive HTML report with all findings
